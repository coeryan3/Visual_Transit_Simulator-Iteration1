  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Task 1 description of the VTS software. The Visual Transit Simulator (VTS) is a program which models the bus transit system at the UMN Twin Cities campus. It simulates buses as they travel along their routes, picking up and dropping off passengers at the appropriate stops. Many aspects of the simulation are configurable via a configuration file. VTS includes a visual component to the simulation which shows users the progress of buses along their routes in a web application that can be viewed in a browser. The visualization also includes a user interface which allows the user to start and pause the simulation as well as specify how long the simulation should run. The visual and simulation components of VTS communicate via websockets. The source code of VTS is divided into two modules, the visualization module and the simulation module. Each has its own associated classes which are outlined in the UML diagrams below. </p>
